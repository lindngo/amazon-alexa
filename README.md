# Amazon Shopping Data

## Overview
For this project, I used SQL to analyze a demo dataset, created by my professor for our product management course, that contained Alexa Voice shopping data. From this dataset, I wanted to draw insights on what category of products are typically bought on Amazon, what type of products households buy, and more.
